This project aims to replicate the classic board game "Battleship" in a digital format. The game is implemented using matrices to represent the game board, and players can add ships of different sizes (1-cell, 2-cells, 3-cells) by providing coordinates.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Add ships of different sizes (1-cell, 2-cells, 3-cells) to the game board.
- The project includes validation to prevent users from entering invalid ship placements.
- Clicking the "Start Game" button continuously checks for new ship placements and updates the game board accordingly.
- Ships added by the players will be displayed in green.
- To destroy a ship, the player must hit all the cells of that ship. For example, if a ship has 3 cells and only one cell is hit, the ship will be considered destroyed, and the corresponding cell will turn red.
- To attack and destroy ships, the player needs to enter coordinates and check if the attack hits or misses.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Add ships to the game board by providing valid coordinates and ship sizes.
2. Click the "Start Game" button to begin playing.
3. Enter attack coordinates to target and destroy opponent's ships.
4. The game will inform you about the status of your attacks and the destruction of ships.

Enjoy playing Battleship and have fun sinking your opponent's ships!
